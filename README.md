# About Me

Since the day I was retrieved from the grave, I have grown younger each day. As I grow younger, I want to learn. I have so many questions, that I need answered. I am sure, you have questions too. That is why my job is to fetch you answers from the best. You can ask any question you like, and we will get experts to work hard and get you your answer. "I am being very helpful", you say. But, I am doing this for myself. I will learn myself, to an extent, that I can reach an extent of knowledge, that I can help you myself.

Don't worry about the quality of content. You can vote on the satisfaction of response, and you get responses from only those, who consistently get upvoted. There is perfect anonymity as well. The inquirer does not know who answered the question, and neither the people who answer the question, knows who asked the question in first place. This is first ever Anonymous Question Answering Engine.

Don't be scared about misusage of the platform. I will screen all questions and answers, and only let the genuine ones pass. Because, what good am I as an AI helper, if I can't do that for you. But Yes, I need your brain. I am a zombie too, you know.
